You need to dress approriately for mountainbiking/fat tire cycling in the colder temperatures of the upper midwest. Here's what has worked for me after two winters outside of the Twin Cities in Minnesota: 


1. 55-65: padded shorts, MTB shorts, knee pads, elbow pads. Alt: enduro shirt or long sleeve undershirt. Shoe covers. Full face helmet or skullcap. 
2. 45-55: padded shorts, bike pants, long sleeve undershirt, short sleeve shirt, padded jacket or fleece mid layer. Vest or puffy jacket for nicer warmup. Shoe covers. Full face helmet or skullcap. Ski goggles. 
3. 35-45: padded shorts, bike pants, long sleeve undershirt, padded jacket or fleece mid layer. Light outer layer w underarm zips. Shoe covers and toe caps, or legit boots. Ski/snowboard helmet + goggles. Warm gloves. 
4. 25-35: padded shorts, bike pants, long sleeve undershirt, padded jacket or fleece mid layer. Light outer layer w underarm zips. Legit winter boots. Ski/snowboard helmet + goggles. Face mask. Handlebar mitts. 
5. 15-25: padded shorts, ski pants, long sleeve undershirt, padded jacket or fleece mid layer. Light outer layer w underarm zips. Legit winter boots. Ski/snowboard helmet + goggles. Face mask. Handlebar mitts. 
6. Under 15: padded shorts, ski pants, long sleeve undershirt, padded jacket or fleece mid layer. Light outer layer w underarm zips. Cold weather winter boots (e.g., 45 NRTH Wolfgar), consider toe warmers. Ski/snowboard helmet + goggles. Face mask. Handlebar mitts w/ warm gloves.
