abstract: "In vivo--labeled MSCs demonstrated significantly higher ferumoxytol uptake compared with ex vivo--labeled cells. With electron microscopy, iron oxide nanoparticles were localized in secondary lysosomes. In vivo--labeled cells demonstrated significant T2 shortening effects in vitro and in vivo when they were compared with unlabeled control cells (T2 in vivo, 15.4 vs 24.4 msec; P < .05) and could be tracked in osteochondral defects for 4 weeks. Histologic examination confirmed the presence of iron in labeled transplants and defect remodeling.  Conclusion: Intravenous ferumoxytol can be used to effectively label MSCs in vivo and can be used for tracking of stem cell transplants with MR imaging. This method eliminates risks of contamination and biologic alteration of MSCs associated with ex vivo--labeling procedures."
