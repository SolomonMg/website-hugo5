I like big, policy-relevant social science projects. I've spent much of my career leading technical teams in industry, while managing to conduct scholarly research and participate in the public sphere -- [media fun/press clips here](#media). During the 2020 election cycle, I was Chief Scientist at [ACRONYM](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/politics/Facebook-Acronym-advertising.html), where my team drove investment by (correctly) [modeling the electoral importance of Georgia](/post/what-the-polls-got-wrong-in-2020/), oversaw a meta-analytic [ML system to generate estimates of persuasive messaging impact](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-haha-ratio-learning-from-facebooks-emoji-reactions-to-predict-persuasion-effects-of-fcd9180ea5dd) leveraging hundreds of past experiments and online behavioral data, and conducted the largest ever [digital advertsing field experiment in politics](/publication/aggarwal-2023-2-million-experiment/).
<!-- --an amazing collaboration with [Minali Aggarwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minali-aggarwal/), [Sylvan Zheng](https://sylvan.fish/), [Dan Fankowski](https://medium.com/@dfrankow) and [James Barnes](http://www.jameslbarnes.com/)-->

At Facebook, I led the technical effort to release a [differentially private data set reflecting more than an exabyte of media data](/project/condor_data_release/), and worked on prototypes that blend ML and experimentation (heterogenous effect estimation and contextual bandits). 

I founded the Data Lab at Pew Research Center, where my team conducted algorithmic audits of [Google Image searches](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/12/17/gender-and-jobs-in-online-image-searches/) and [news photos on Facebook](https://www.journalism.org/2019/05/23/men-appear-twice-as-often-as-women-in-news-photos-on-facebook/), used ML to [study inauthentic and automated behavior on Twitter](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/04/09/bots-in-the-twittersphere/), and used NLP to understand the role of ideology and [power structures](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/21/highly-ideological-members-of-congress-have-more-facebook-followers-than-moderates-do/) embedded in how members of [congress use social media to communicate](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2017/02/23/partisan-conflict-and-congressional-outreach/). 

My work on [election forecasts](publication/wlm-2019-projecting/) sparked [public debates](https://twitter.com/SolomonMg/status/1311649795258421252?s=20) about the ethics and consequences of models projecting the results of elections, and prompted [FiveThirtyEight to change their user interface](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-whats-so-wrong-with-nancy-pelosi/) to address concerns raised by the work.  

My most widely cited work is from my dissertation, which identifies the critical drivers of what we consume online. Social signals (and ranking) dominate ideological signals, published in [Communication Research]](pdf/SocialNewsCommRes.pdf), and the networks we form on social media more powerfully govern exposure to ideologically diverse content than ranking or individal preference, published in [Science](pdf/Science-2015-Bakshy-1130-2.pdf). While at Stanford, I also did work to uncover [bias in visual portrayals of African American candidates in political attack ads](https://solomonmg.github.io/pdf/HSVmetricsCampaignsDarknessPOQFINAL.pdf), worked with a lab at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital on a number of [imaging studies](http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.11110715) and wrote a book about how members of congress claim credit, [*The Impression of Influence*](pdf/GrimmerWestwoodMessingBook.pdf) with [Justin Grimmer](https://www.justingrimmer.org/) and [Sean Westwood](https://www.dartmouth.edu/~seanjwestwood/) which was published by Princeton University Press.

<!-- Some past work using [privacy tech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04049) to [unlock research/ML](pdf/Facebook_DP_URLs_Dataset.pdf) in corporate data warehouses. 

Accidentally fell into data science in 2006 when my team couldn't get budget for Stata and so got paid for 2 years to learn R.
