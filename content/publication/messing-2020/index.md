abstract: "One of the largest social science data sets ever constructed, meant to facilitate research on misinformation from across the web, shared and spread on Facebook. It contains exposure data describing external links that billions of users saw and read while using the site. The data set goes beyond URL-level data, breaking down exposure and interactions by month, country, age, gender, and in the U.S., political page affinity (see Barbera et al 2015).   "
